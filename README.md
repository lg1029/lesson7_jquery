### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. (jQuery code conforms to JavaScript rules, but uses shortcuts that look like a different language. So, jQuery statements begin with $ so the computer knows to interpret the code using the jQuery library.)
2. (jQuery statements can be grouped into functions, and so backward-compatible event listeners are easier done with jQuery.)
3. (Animation effects such as fadeIn and slideUp can be built into code to translate into movement on the application.)
